# Enrichment Plot

Plot metabolic pathway presence/absence from Roary and BioCyc enrichment table data. Roary allows for fast analysis of genes present and absent in a collection of prokaryote genomes. To assign these genes to pathways, BioCyc's SMartTable system is used (required by the user to generate using an organism database, or multiple, of their choice). Firstly, a tidied list of genes from Roary's text output is required.
